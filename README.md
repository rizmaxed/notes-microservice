# Notes Microservice - A Production-grade Serverless Notes API

This project demonstrates how to build, deploy, and monitor a **Production-grade Serverless Notes API** using AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM), GitHub-integrated CI/CD pipeline, and AWS observability tooling.

Each function in this microservice is responsible for a specific CRUD operation and is instrumented with **AWS Lambda Powertools** for logging, metrics, and X-Ray tracing. A complete DevOps workflow is configured using **AWS CodePipeline** and **CodeBuild** to enable automated deployments on each GitHub push.

## Features

- 🧩 Modular microservice design (1 Lambda = 1 route)
- ⚙️ GitHub → CodePipeline → CodeBuild → SAM deployment
- 🔍 AWS Lambda Powertools for:
  - Structured JSON logs  
  - Custom CloudWatch metrics  
  - AWS X-Ray tracing with annotations and metadata  
- 🔐 Fine-grained IAM roles for Lambda + CodeBuild + CodePipeline
- 🔁 DynamoDB for persistence with TTL and GSI support
- 🌐 CORS-enabled API Gateway with custom headers for multi-user support

## Lab Scenario (for learners)

You're building a serverless Notes API using AWS services. The goal is to:

- Build, deploy, and test the app end-to-end  
- Automate CI/CD from GitHub to AWS using SAM, CodePipeline, and CodeBuild  
- Use Powertools for observability (structured logs, metrics, X-Ray traces)  
- Analyze logs with CloudWatch Logs Insights  
- Trace errors and performance bottlenecks using AWS X-Ray
