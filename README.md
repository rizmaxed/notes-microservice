# Notes Microservice ¬∑ Serverless Application with AWS SAM, CodePipeline & Powertools

This project demonstrates how to build, deploy, and monitor a **Production-grade Serverless Notes API** using AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM), GitHub-integrated CI/CD pipeline, and AWS observability tooling.

Each function in this microservice is responsible for a specific CRUD operation and is instrumented with **AWS Lambda Powertools** for logging, metrics, and X-Ray tracing. A complete DevOps workflow is configured using **AWS CodePipeline** and **CodeBuild** to enable automated deployments on each GitHub push.

## Lab Scenario (for learners)

You're building a serverless Notes API using AWS services. The goal is to:

- Build, deploy, and test the app end-to-end
- Automate CI/CD from GitHub to AWS using SAM, CodePipeline, and CodeBuild
- Use Powertools for observability (structured logs, metrics, X-Ray traces)
- Analyze logs with CloudWatch Logs Insights
- Trace errors and performance bottlenecks using AWS X-Ray
